Cross-browser adblocking meant to be as lightweight as possible, using over 140k hostnames curated by user [Steven Black](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts) that are popular within the PiHole community.

### Should I use this?

Maybe. If you're looking for a comprehensive, free, and open-source adblocker, your first choice should be [uBlock](https://ublockorigin.com/).

This is a toy project to explore extension development, but could be considered as a feature-lite alternative to other adblockers.

### Can I clone this?

Yes, do whatever you want with it! Run the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/givensuman/advark
```

install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

and build a local version

```bash
pnpm build
```

### Why is the logo a hedgehog?

You ask too many questions.
